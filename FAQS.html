    What type of organization is the Belgian Exchange Program? 
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The 2-week educational and cultural exchange program between high school students in the
    greater Sacramento area and the Damien Institute of Aarschot, Belgium has been happening for
    over 40 years. It was originally sponsored by a school in the San Juan Unified School District -
    many say that it was Rio Americano HS that sponsored the program but those affiliated with the
    program now do not know for sure. At some point the SJUSD opted to no longer officially
    sponsor the exchange so families who had participated in the program over the years, took over
    coordinating with the teachers and principal at the Damien Institute.

    <br>
    <br>
    Currently the program is incorporated as a non-profit public benefit organization and registered
    with the State of California as a charitable organization.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded"> 
    What is the purpose of the Belgian Exchange Program?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The purpose of our program is to facilitate an educational and cultural exchange between high
    school students in the greater Sacramento area and The Damien Institute of Aarschot, Belgium.
    The program seeks to introduce high school students from Belgium to the American way of life
    and to share with them California’s history and culture and some of Northern California’s
    treasures, like Yosemite, San Francisco, the State Capitol and the California History Museum.
    The return trip to Belgium offers an opportunity for the Belgians to share their history and culture
    with the American students and includes a visit to a holocaust transport station, the Belgian
    parliament house in Brussels and an overnight trip to Paris.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    When does the exchange occur?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The Belgian students and their teachers/chaperones travel to Sacramento in the spring. They
    are typically here for 14-15 days and the trip usually overlaps with Sacramento area high
    schools’ spring break.

    <br>
    <br>

    The American students and our chaperones travel to Belgium in late June after Sacramento
    area high schools’ terms have concluded for the summer.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    How old are the Belgian students who participate in the exchange?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The Belgian students are seniors in high school so typically 17 or 18 years old.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    Can my family be a Host Family for a Belgian Student?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    Your family can serve as a host family if you have a high school student who is living at your
    home and is at least a sophomore, junior or senior at the time the Belgian student arrives in the
    spring. The American student must also be 16 years old to go on the return trip to Belgium in
    the summer.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    What do I have to do as a Host Family?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span class="boldneeded">A. Housing:</span>
    <br>
    If you choose to be a host family, you need to be able to house and feed the Belgian student for
    the entire time that they are in Sacramento. This is typically a 14-15 day period in the spring
    that overlaps with most high schools’ spring break. The Belgian student needs to have a bed or
    air mattress to sleep on and can share a room with your high school student of the same
    gender.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <span class="boldneeded">B. Transportation:</span>
    <br>
    There are several events planned during the Belgian’s visit. Please see the attached calendar
    of events for a better description. The host family does not need to participate in all of the
    events planned for the Belgian students, but you do need to ensure that your student is
    transported to and from the pick up and drop off location so that they can attend the events.
    <br>
    <br>

    <span class="boldneeded">C. Volunteer Requirements:</span>
    <br>
    The program relies on host families to carry out the various events. That means we need host
    families to drive the Belgians and chaperones to the overnight events in Yosemite and San
    Francisco, as well as the day events such as the ski day, Sacramento Day and Sports Day. We
    also need help with the group Welcome and Farewell dinners. We ask that each host family
    volunteer for one of these events. Host families must pay their own costs associated with your
    volunteer requirement such as gas, lodging and food.
    <br>
    <br>

    <span class="boldneeded">D. Attendance at Events:</span>
    <br>
    The host family does not need to attend all of the scheduled events, with the exception of the
    Welcome and Farewell dinners. Additionally, members of the host family are permitted to attend
    the trip to Yosemite, San Francisco and the ski trip if space allows and we have enough drivers,
    but must pay their own costs associated with the trips, such as lodging and food.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    Does my student have to go on the return trip to Belgium in order to be a host family?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    Families who participate as a host family must commit to sending their high school student on
    the return trip to Belgium. This is the basis of our exchange program. We occasionally have
    the need for additional host families and this requirement may be waived.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    What efforts are in place to assure that my student will be safe on the return trip to Belgium?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    While we can make no assurances that traveling in a foreign country can be completely safe,
    we do send adult chaperones to accompany the American students on the return trip to
    Belgium. Additionally the Belgians have 4-6 adult chaperones who also travel with the Americans on the events during the return trip. The Belgian coordinators have been organizing
    and chaperoning these events for 40+ years and exercise every caution in doing so.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    Do I have to pay anything to participate as a host family?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The events that we plan for the Belgian students do cost money. Our arrangement with the
    Belgian coordinators is that while their students are in America, we will pay the costs of the
    events. This includes overnight lodging, food and event site rental costs for the Welcome and
    Farewell dinners.
    <br>
    <br>

    The American coordinators book the overnight lodging in Yosemite and San Francisco,
    purchase all food for those events, book the event locations for the Welcome and Farewell
    dinners and the tour of the California HIstory Museum. We do ask for a donation of $300.00 to
    cover the costs of these events for your Belgian student. You may also incur incidental
    expenses in housing your Belgian student during their stay or for any other events you choose
    to share with them outside of the planned events.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    What are the costs associated with sending my student to Belgium?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The cost of the flight to Belgium is usually no more than $1800.00 and if we fly out of either
    Sacramento or San Francisco. We use a travel company, Wolfe Tours, to book our flight. You
    will create an account for your student and can begin making payments on the flights anytime.
    <br>
    <br>

    While our American students are in Belgium, the Belgian program pays for costs associated
    with the events that our students participate in. So the American students just need to bring
    spending money while in Europe.

    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="boldneeded">
    When are the donation and flight costs due and where do we send them?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    The hosting donation is due by the date of our January meeting. However we are willing to
    work with families who need a bit more time or would like to pay in increments. We use a tour
    company to book the group flight. You can find the link to the travel company on our website.
    You should create an account with the travel company and make payments directly to them.
    The full cost of the flight is due 60 days from travel. You may send the $300.00 hosting
    donation to:

    We do not hold fundraiser but students are encouraged to plan and host fundraisers on their
    own or as a group, in order to raise money for the cost of participating in the program

    If you would like to serve as one of our host families for the upcoming spring, please send an

    they are attending as well as the names and contact email and phone numbers for all parents.
    We typically fill up fast and have a waiting list for families who wish to participate. Once we
    receive your host donation, we will confirm your participation as a host family. You should also
    complete all of the participation forms that are also on our google site, and email them to us.
